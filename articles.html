<strong>These articles</strong> cover a varety of CSS topics and other related issues.
Some are written by Guest Authors, and others were written by John Gallant, Holly Bergevin, occasionally for
publication at
<a href="http://www.communitymx.com/"><strong>Communitymx.com</strong></a>.
The <strong>CMX</strong> partner agreement prevents us from publishing them
here, so those articles are linked from this page.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Community MX</strong> is a subscription site with a mix of free and for-pay articles, but
it is <em>not</em> necessary to subscribe in order to read all these articles.
</p>

<p>
That's right, <strong>CMX</strong> offers a
<a href="http://www.communitymx.com/joincmx.cfm"><strong>free 10 day trial</strong></a>,
during which time you may read all of the
<strong>CMX</strong> published articles without paying a cent, and no strings
attached. <em>But beware!</em> <strong>CMX</strong> has been known to be
extremely habit forming! It is entirely possible that you will find yourself
unable to live without <strong>CMX</strong>, once you see all it has to offer
a web developer. We're sneaky that way.
