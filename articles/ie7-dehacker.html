If you only want to know the quick and dirty way to feed rules to IE only,
go to <a href="haslayout.html">this&nbsp;page</a> which explains
one method to do so.
</p>

<p>
In 2005 Microsoft  started cleaning up a lot of its selector support problems,
but a lot of coders were using these IE problems to hack special rules for the
Explorer browser. In the long run the newly-supported CSS selectors will
make our jobs easier, but in the short run it  mean rewriting stylesheets
and updating our IE-coddling methods so they don't explode in our faces.
</p>

<p>
A number of CSS hacks that relied on IEwin's failure to support
certain advanced selectors are failing to "work" because IE7 now supports those selectors
and so reads CSS rules not intended for it. If this is you, read on...
</p>

<h2>Should We Even Bother?</h2>

<p>
It's a simple fact that the majority browser (IE/Win) cannot be made
to handle complex CSS designs without the ability to induce
<a href="http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html"><strong>hasLayout</strong></a>
on certain buggy elements within those layouts.
The <a href="haslayout.html">zoom&nbsp;fix</a>
triggers hasLayout on a box and is utterly critical when it comes to taming IE's
many list and float bugs, and we would be greatly restricted in the choice of designs .
</p>

<p>
However, aside from the zoom fix, it is possible to go entirely or almost hack-free
by intelligently working around IE's CSS failures. When we design our sites we try to make
the CSS as clean as possible, and only feed IEwin custom styles as a last resort,
and only when forced to do so by client requirements. Other modern browsers are held to
a higher standard and if problems do occur in them and can't be worked around,
we just shrug and assume the problem will be fixed eventually. Only when that
problem is a page-breaker will we go so far as to redesign the page.
</p>

<p>
As we say, this is our design philosophy, and you are entitled to yours as well.
Anyway, let's get right into the heart of the issue, specifically the changes we can
expect from IE7, and new ways to handle old problems.
</p>

<h2>What's In, What's Out</h2>

<p>
Let's look at what we are told will be the relevant changes to IE7. There are two
CSS &quot;combinators&quot; that will become supported, and one element structure
will be eliminated. First the two CSS combinators:
</p>

<ul class="darkblue indented" style="list-style: none;">

<li>
<h5><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#x13">The Child Selector</a></h5>

<p>
This selector uses a &quot;>&quot; symbol as a &quot;combinator&quot; that is
placed between two parts
of a CSS selector, and indicates that the target of the rule is the element on the
right side of the &quot;>&quot; combinator, but <em>only</em> when that element
is a direct child of the element to the left of the combinator. Thus, the
selector <strong>table>td</strong> can never target any element, because TD's
are <em>never</em> direct children of tables, only of TR's. On the other hand,
the selector <strong>tr>td</strong> would select <em>every</em> TD on the page, since
all TD's are direct children of TR's.
</p>

<p>
The main difference between the Child combinator and the familiar space combinator
is that the space combinator is a &quot;descendant&quot; combinator, meaning that
the element to the right of the space only needs to be between the tags of the
element on the left to be selected. So with the selector
<strong>table&nbsp;td</strong>, all TD's will selected, since TD's always fall
between the tag pair of one table or another.
</p>

<p>
The Child combinator is quite useful for targeting rules to direct children of
an element, <em>without</em> also targeting the more deeply nested descendants as well.
Unfortunately, up until IE7 there was no point in using it for its intended purpose,
since so few of the viewing public would get the benefits of the styling.
</p>

<p>
It did however have a &quot;useful&quot; function in the writing of rules that IEwin would reliably
ignore, such as <strong>html>body&nbsp;&nbsp;.targetelement</strong>. It works because
the body is always a direct child of html, making that part of the selector true at all times.
Then the space combinator in front of <strong>.targetelement</strong> (or any other
selected element) allows the styles to be applied anywhere within the body element.
</p>

<p>
IEwin just ignores the entire rule because it cannot recognize that child combinator.
Now that support is coming, IE7 will be able to view such hacked CSS. But since
that browser will <em>still</em> have quite a few failings, letting it get a look
at those hacks could be less than desirable, to say the least.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<h5><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#adjacent-selectors">The Adjacent Sibling Selector</a></h5>

<p>
This selector is a &quot;+&quot; combinator symbol placed between parts of a selector, and is very
similar to the Child combinator. The only difference between the two is that while
the Child combinator points to direct children of an element, the Adjacent Sibling combinator
points to an element which directly <em>follows</em> another element in the source.
</p>

<p>
Thus the selector <strong>tr+td</strong> cannot select anything, because TD's never
directly follows a TR. Instead, TD's are contained <em>inside</em> TR's, and that
is not considered to be &quot;following&quot; the TR. However, the selector <strong>tr+tr</strong>
would select any TR that directly followed another TR, which means that every TR
within a table would be selected except for the very first TR in that table.
</p>
<p>
Get it? An adjacent sibling element not only follows its previous sibling, but is
also completely separate from it. Further, if two DIV's are in sequence and each
contains a paragraph, those two paragraphs are <em>not</em> considered siblings, because they
reside in different parent elements. The fact that one follows another means nothing
unless the following sibling starts at the same point where the previous sibling ends.
</p>

<p>
It's possible to point a Sibling selector at any one of a sequence of adjacent
elements, simply by repeating the use of the combinator, so the selector
<strong>td+td+td</strong> would select all TD's that come directly after
two previous TD's. This also means that the the third, fourth, fifth, and any
remaining TD's in a table row would receive the styles attached to such a selector,
since they all have two TD's directly before them in the table row.
</p>

<p>
The first two TD's in the next table row would <em>not</em> be selected, because they are
enclosed in a different TR. But then of course any remaining TD's in that row <em>would</em>
be selected, just as in the previous table row.
</p>

<p class="tip">
Be aware that IE7 likes to count HTML comments as siblings, so if you start using this
combinator as intended then be sure to place comments <em>inside</em> the siblings, not on the outside
where they will fall between the siblings and be counted as one of them! Oy...
</p>

<p>
Again, the Adjacent Sibling combinator will come in real handy for the future, but right now
there are CSS hacks out there that utilize it, much like the Child combinator.
Not good.
</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>
Clearly we need to begin eliminating these hacks from our CSS files <em>before</em>
our clients start screaming bloody murder, not after.
</p>

<h3>But, weren't there <em>three?</em></h3>

<p>
Oh, you want to know about that structural thing? Well, the hack that uses
it is called the <strong>star-html</strong> hack, and it works by taking advantage
of an oddity in Explorer's treatment of the <strong>Document&nbsp;Object&nbsp;Model</strong>,
or <strong>DOM</strong> for short. Simply stated, all web pages start with a root element
called <strong>html</strong>, which then contains two children, the <strong>head</strong>
and the <strong>body</strong> elements. Those two then contain other children, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Most browsers obey this arrangement, but <strong>Explorer</strong> for both
<strong>Win</strong> and <strong>Mac</strong> do not.
They seem to think there is a mysterious element <em>enclosing the html element!</em>
It's pretty strange, but in fact this extra outer &quot;root&quot; element has no apparent
ill effects on web pages, and remained unnoticed for years, until
<a href="http://www.info.com.ph/~etan/w3pantheon/style/csshub.html">Edwardson&nbsp;Tan</a>
began experimenting with CSS selectors. He found that a selector written as
<strong>*&nbsp;html&nbsp;&nbsp;.targetelement</strong> would apply the styles to
<strong>.targetelement</strong>, but only for the IE browsers.
</p>

<p>
Think about it. That star is the &quot;universal&quot; selector, so it points
to any element, but it comes <em>before</em> <strong>html</strong>. Therefore,
the full selector in effect says: &quot;Select <strong>.targetelement</strong> when it
is contained within <strong>html</strong>, <em>and</em> when <strong>html</strong> is
contained within any other element&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Obviously since <strong>html</strong> is the root element on the page, it <em>cannot</em>
be contained by any other element, but that's exactly what IE thinks! We don't
know the name of this element, but the star selector part of that hack does not care,
as long as there <em>is</em> such an element surrounding <strong>html</strong>.
</p>

<p>
As you can imagine, this hack has proved quite useful, particularly when wrapped in
a <a href="http://www.sam-i-am.com/work/sandbox/css/mac_ie5_hack.html">different&nbsp;hack</a>
that hides the star-html hack from IEmac. By doing that, you create a
combination hack which will feed rules directly to IEwin, <em>and no other browser</em>.
Such a combo hack is perfect for handling box model issues and anything else that
IEwin needs to see exclusively, particularly the Holly hack.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, Microsoft has seen fit for some reason to lose that strange &quot;root&quot;
element in IE7, leaving <strong>html</strong> as the correct root. That's very compliant of
them, but it presents a problem. Yep, just as with the newly supported combinators,
any pages that use this hack will start breaking in IE7, but this time it's because
IE7 will <em>not</em> be able to read those special rules it needs so badly.
</p>

<h2>Desperately Seeking Solutions</h2>

<p>
Happily for us, Microsoft also saw fit to develop a browser feature called
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/overview/ccomment_ovw.asp">Conditional&nbsp;Comments</a>
(back in the IE5win version). CC's allow coders to write an HTML comment in a way
that will &quot;alert&quot; IEwin, causing it to peek inside the CC
and parse what it finds there. Other browsers do not have this feature, and so
they see just a normal comment, ignoring it and all it contains.
</p>

<p>
See where we are going with this? Those formerly useful (but now embarrassing) CSS
hacks in our stylesheets may be stripped out of the stylesheets and placed into a
separate stylesheet file. Then that new &quot;IEwin hacks&quot; CSS file may be called into
the page via a head link that has been
hidden within a conditional comment. All other browsers (even IEmac) will see a
normal comment and just pass over it to the following code. IEwin however will look
inside the CC, see the link, call the special hack-filled CSS file, and add those
rules to the cascade just like any other stylesheet. Sweet! Here's how it would look:
</p>

<p class="code">
&lt;!--[if IE]><br />
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="iehacks.css" /><br />
&lt;![endif]-->
</p>

<p>
Okay, it's not as convenient as the seductively useful star-html hack, but unlike
that hack, CC's are not going to go away, ever. Furthermore, CC's boast rock solid
reliability and safety. Not even the W3C&nbsp;Validator will know that the CC is anything
other than a normal comment, so the page will validate just fine, even if your hack
file is stuffed full of invalid proprietary MS rules.
</p>

<p>
Of course we all understand that this CC enabled CSS file is for rules that will
make IEwin behave as close to the specs as possible, right? What's that? You <em>really</em>
want to use all those cool MS proprietary scrollbar stylings, do you? Well if you must,
at least this method will squirrel away those icky rules apart from the nice clean
CSS in the main sheet. That way, validation is assured.
</p>

<p class="tip">
From reading
<a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2005/10/13/bye_bye_tan_/">Mezzoblue's</a>
blog comments we see that if one is using XSLT, the brackets contained within the
CC tags can cause trouble. Happily
<a href="http://www.nickfitz.co.uk/">Nick&nbsp;Fitzsimons</a> also saw those comments,
and Nick has described for us how to go about
<a href="http://www.nickfitz.co.uk/2005/10/27/ie-conditional-comments-in-xslt-10/">generating&nbsp;CC's&nbsp;via&nbsp;XSLT</a>.
Thanks Nick!



</p>

<p>
Anyway, let's get right into the details of cleaning up a typical hack-ridden web
page, shall we? BTW, there's <em>lots</em> of pages just like that, right
here at PIE! Oh well...
</p>

<h2>Going Legit</h2>

<p>
Rather than embarrassing anyone by exposing their hacks to public ridicule, we were going
to do one of our own pages, but it seems that none contain any hacks other than
the star-html hack. So instead we will show how to strip out hacks that might be
found in other real world web pages.
</p>

<p class="tip">
All the discussion to follow assumes that IEwin is in &quot;standards&quot; mode, via a
<a href="http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?cid=85FEE">correct&nbsp;doctype</a>.
If IEwin is allowed to fall back to &quot;quirks&quot; mode
by an old, incorrect, or missing doctype, all bets are off, and the observed behaviors
might appear radically different. Microsoft has said that IEwin's future improvements
will depend on IE being in standards mode, and quirks mode will be left for sites that
must maintain lots of legacy code that would break if handled strictly according
to the standards.
</p>

<h4>The Tantek hack</h4>

<p class="code">
#wrapper {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 10px solid black;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 770px; /* IE5.x/win sees this.. */<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;voice-family: "\"}\"";<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;voice-family: inherit;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 750px; /* ..but not this &quot;standards&quot; width value.. */<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
&nbsp;<br />
html>body #wrapper {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 750px; /* ..or this reinforcement of the standards width. */<br />
}
</p>

<p>
That's the well known
<a href="http://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/boxmodelhack.html"><strong>Tantek&nbsp;hack</strong></a>,
and it feeds a special width to IEwin versions before IE6 to combat the
<a href="http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?cid=E0989953B6F20B41">box&nbsp;model&nbsp;problem</a>,
and also gave Opera 5 a second hacked rule using the Child selector, because
that browser was also fooled by the primary Tantek hack just like the early IEwin's
were. All of this mess was superseded by the simpler star-html hack, but many web pages
still have the Tantek hack. The specific goal of the above example hack is to
create a wrapper box that is 770px wide when the 10px side borders are added on to
the stated 750px width.
</p>

<p>
Technically this hack does not need to be stripped out, because the hack primarily works
via the use of escapes to hide certain critical characters from the early IE's. IE6, IE7,
and all other modern browsers are not fooled by these legal escapes, so nothing can
go wrong by letting IE7 see the hack. Not even the last part is dangerous, because
that Child hack simply feeds the &quot;standards&quot; width, which IE6 and IE7 are
already getting from the first part of the hack. If IE7 suddenly starts reading that
Child hack, it will get the correct value anyway.
</p>

<p>
Still, as long as we are stripping dangerous hacks, let's remove that one as well.
Naturally the border rule and all other ordinary CSS rules are left within the main
CSS file, along with the &quot;standards&quot; compliant 750px width. Remember
that our CC enabled <strong>hacks.css</strong> file will be seen only by IEwin,
versions 5 and up, so no hacks to hide the file from IEmac are needed.
</p>

<h3>Conditional Comments</h3>

<p>
It so happens that CC's come in several varieties that different versions of
IEwin will either read or ignore, depending on the code placed within the starting
tag of the conditional comment. See the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/overview/ccomment_ovw.asp">Microsoft&nbsp;page</a>
for specifics, and
<a href="multiIE.html">Taming&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Multiple&nbsp;IE&nbsp;Standalones</a>
here at PIE for lots more details and useful tips on CC's.
</p>

<p>
So you could create two different hack files, one that all IEwin versions can
see for general hacks, and another just for box model issues and whatever other
hacking might be needed specifically for IEwin versions prior to IE6:
</p>

<p class="code">
&lt;!--[if IE]><br />
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="iehacks.css" /><br />
&lt;![endif]--><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&lt;!--[if IE 5]><br />
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="iehacks-5.css" /><br />
&lt;![endif]-->
</p>

<p>
By adding that &quot;5&quot; in the start tag, you are saying that only versions
of IEwin that begin with a 5 should read the CC. IE5.5's version does begin with
a 5, so it does read the CC along with IE5win.
</p>

<p>
Once these files exist, it is a simple matter to segregate box model widths and
heights within the version 5 only file. This does avoid the need for any CSS
hacking at all, but of course there is one more special CSS file to deal
with, possibly increasing the chances of errors and difficulties in the future.
</p>

<p>
When using this method, make sure that the links for the CC's come later than
the main CSS file link in the source, and that the rules within the CC's have at least the same
or higher
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/cascade.html#specificity">specificity</a>
than any similar rules in the main sheet. If not, your
hacks will not override those primary rules for IEwin, and will fail to do their jobs.
Also be sure that if the two different CC linked CSS files have conflicting rules,
that the ordering and/or specificity is proper, or there could be trouble there too.
</p>

<h4>Hybrid Hacking</h4>

<p>
Once stripped, the above hack is replaced in the <strong>iehacks.css</strong>
file with this code:
</p>

<p class="code">
<strong>iehacks.css</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
#wrapper {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 770px;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;wid<span style="color: red;">\</span>th: 750px;<br />
}
</p>

<p>
See that red-colored &quot;escape&quot; inside the second property name? It's a legal
'escape' backslash and should be ignored, but when it is inside the
property name it is <em>not</em> ignored by IE5 and IE5.5
for Windows. Instead it causes those browsers to ignore the following &quot;t&quot;
character in this case, thus making the property name unreadable to them. So the result is that
all the IEwin versions get the widened width, and then IE6 and IE7 will see and
obey the second rule with the standards width. Just remember that the escape must
not come directly before any of the first six alphabetical characters, because they
have special meanings when preceeded by an escape. If we had written it as
&quot;wi\dth&quot;, then IE6 and IE7 would ignore the &quot;d&quot; and see
&quot;with&quot; as the property name. Not good. Specifically the forbidden characters are
a, b, c, d, e, and f.
</p>

<p>
Happily there is always at least one character inside every property that isn't one
of the first six, and so may be safely escaped this way. However, you can't escape
the &quot;w&quot; in &quot;width&quot;, because IE5.5 is somehow able to ignore
the escape when it comes first. Keep the escape within the name and it will work every time.
Since IE5 and IE5.5 are the browsers that are fooled by the escape and are also the
ones with the box model problem, it's a perfect fit and won't cause trouble in the
future.
</p>

<h3>The Child and Adjacent Sibling Hacks</h3>

<p>
These combinators when used as hacks are always meant to prevent IEwin
from seeing a rule that would cause it to break in some way. So when one appears
in a CSS file, it can't simply be removed without depriving the other browsers
of the styles within that rule. Yes, the Child hack portion of the selector can
be deleted, leaving a simple rule for IE7, but then older IEwin's would see it
and break. Somehow we need to simplify the rule without letting IEwin get a look at it.
</p>

<p>
In fact, this is not actually possible, so instead we will let IEwin see the simple
unhacked rule, and then &quot;negate&quot; that rule from within the general CC,
where non-IEwin browsers won't be affected.
</p>

<p>
One common use for the Child hack is to give IEwin a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-height">height</a>
while other browsers get only a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#propdef-min-height">min-height</a>.
Since IEwin will always
<a href="../explorer/expandingboxbug.html">enlarge&nbsp;any&nbsp;dimension</a>
when needed to keep content contained, a height is actually treated as a min-height by IEwin.
The important thing is not to let other browsers see the height meant for IEwin only.
Typically it is done this way:
</p>

<p class="code">
#wrapper {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;min-height: 500px; /* IEwin does not support min-height */<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 500px;<br />
}<br />
&nbsp;<br />
html>body #wrapper {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;height: auto;<br />
}
</p>

<p>
This sets both a min-height and height to the same value, and then in the Child-hacked rule
where IEwin is not paying attention, the height is set back to the default <strong>auto</strong>.
Unfortunately IE7 will be able to read that second rule, and it so happens that IE7
will still expand boxes just like earlier IEwin versions. This means that the
above rule will make IE7 also reset the height to auto, and so the desired min-height
&quot;effect&quot; will be lost in that browser.
</p>

<p>
The answer here is to delete the Child hack and its <strong>auto</strong> value completely,
and then move the height declaration out of the first rule, sending it instead
to the iehacks.css file. IEwin still gets the length value for height that it needs,
and no other browsers are troubled by it. The problem is now solved, at least until
an IEwin version comes along that does <em>not</em> expand boxes improperly!
</p>

<p>
Even then it is not a big problem, because CC's are so flexible. Let's say that
IE8 has arrived, and it has been redesigned so that it correctly obeys box
dimensions like other browsers. Hopefully such a radically different IE version
will also support min-height. But in any case, we will not want the height rule
meant for IE7 and lower versions to be seen by an IE8 that we have described.
It's also likely that many other things will be improved at the same
time, so there may be a sizable group of special IEwin rules that IE8 should not see.
Thus we would write our CC link call this way:
</p>

<p class="code">
&lt;!--[if lt IE 8]><br />
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="iehacks.css" /><br />
&lt;![endif]-->
</p>

<p>
See that &quot;lt&quot; in the tag code? It stands for &quot;less&nbsp;than&quot; IE8,
so IE8 would be excluded from reading this CC, and won't get the the linked stylesheet.
Depending on future realities within the IE browsers, various combinations of
CC's could be made to handle most anything. Still, let's hope MS does not cause
too many complications for us, eh?
</p>

<p class="tip">
There happens to be something called the
<a href="http://www.dithered.com/css_filters/css_only/owen_hack.html">Owen&nbsp;hack</a>,
which has the selector
<strong>head:first-child+body&nbsp;{}</strong>. This hack was useful because it could not be read
by Opera 6, while Op7 had no trouble with it. Nowadays few care about Op6, but the
hack still lurks within a few stylesheets, and MS is warning against its continued
use.<br /><br />We know the sibling selector will be obeyed by IE7, but the Owen hack also
contains &quot;head:first-child.&quot; That is an advanced CSS
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#x24"><strong>pseudoclass</strong></a>
which IEwin does not currently support, but this MS warning seems to intimate that
<strong>:first-child</strong> and possibly other such selectors might be slated for
support in IE7! True or not, this should be a clear indication that using any
advanced selectors to exclude weak-but-evolving browsers <em>may</em> be counter productive.
A word to the wise, eh?
</p>

<h3>The Star-html Hack</h3>

<p>
There's not too much left to say about this hack. It hides a rule from non-IE
browsers, but allows IEwin and IEmac to view the rule. IE7 will be excluded from
viewing the hack, so any such hacked rules that you think IE7 should see will need to be
moved into iehacks.css, or into a more specifically targeted CC linked stylesheet.
</p>

<p>
The only wrinkle is with the IEmac browser. There may be the occasional hacked
rule that you want IEmac to see along with the IEwin browsers, but once the special rule
is stashed inside the CC, poor IEmac won't be able to access that file or the rules
it contains. The answer to this problem is something we call the Mac-only hack,
dreamed up by Tantek&nbsp;&Ccedil;elik himself (who has been a Microsoft programmer
among many other things). It is the older
<a href="http://www.sam-i-am.com/work/sandbox/css/mac_ie5_hack.html">Mac&nbsp;hiding&nbsp;hack</a>
with a new twist. It's constructed from a special pair of CSS comments, between which
you may place CSS rules that <em>only</em> IEmac will read.
Assuming that IEmac needs something unique such as a width on a normally widthless
float, you can write this into your main stylesheet:
</p>

<p class="code">
/*\*//*/<br />
#floatedbox {width: 200px;}<br />
/* */
</p>

<p>
You can find out how it works
<a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/examples/ie5mac-bpf/">here</a>, but as for this
being an undesirable hack, don't worry about it. The hack depends entirely on a parsing
error in the IEmac engine, caused by the escape within the top comment. No browser
later than Nav 4 has any problem with this arrangement, and no future browser
will either. Furthermore, IEmac is no longer being developed by MS, so there is zero chance
of problems developing as we are seeing with IE7. Use it in good health!
</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
By now you should have a pretty good idea of what's coming at us soon. If your
code is shot thru with CSS hacks like ours, you have two options: Fix it now or
participate in a slow-motion train wreck. It's your choice.
</p>

<p>
There's no point in chewing out Microsoft either. We have been screaming for years
that they should do what they are about to do. Okay, it would be nice for them to fix
all the bugs at the same time, but face it, that ain't gonna happen. MS is definitely
starting to take their issues seriously tho, and IE7 will be just the first step
toward a more compliant Explorer. If MS is willing to face lots of bad vibes in
order to approach full compliance, we prefer to see it as a good sign
for the future.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, why not have a positive attitude? It can't hurt anything, and a lot less
stomach acid is produced as a result. That's our policy and we're stickin' to it!
