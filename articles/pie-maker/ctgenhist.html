      <h1>CSS Source Ordered 1-3 Columned Page Maker v2.90</h1>
      <h3>(released 15 November 2005)<br />Version History and Design Notes</h3>
      <div id="bodytext">
        <p>This project started because I had repeated requests to design 2 and 3 column page
           layouts. I started to think around the basic concepts and found there were only
           three variations: full page width, left aligned and centered. The most common request
           was for a centered design that was under 800 pixels wide to allow viewing in 800x600
           screens.</p>
        <p>AND, they wanted it to Google well, by making it 'source ordered' (putting the content
           first) in design. That was my goal, and here is how it came about ...</p>
		<p>Often I would be refered to an existing site. 'I want it like that, but full height,
           so the footer is at the bottom of the page if the content is too short,' and 'I want
           the columns all the same height, it looks odd only having columns as high as the content.'
		   Hangovers from the printed medium, like brochures, I suppose. However, the more I thought
           about it, the more I could see the sense in this approach.</p>
		<p>They are very difficult to get right across browsers, especially when there are many
           nested inside each other. Given the way the different browsers work margins, padding,
           etc, this should be no surprise.</p>
		<p>So, I figured CSS <b>must</b> be the way forward. I quickly found two sites offering
           designs that partly met my needs (Position is Everything (PIE) and
           <a href="http://www.pmob.co.uk/" target='_blank'>Paul O'Brien's Site</a>). Paul O'B's
           design was full width with a fluid width center column (he has since done one centered
           and under 800 pixels) and the PIEfecta one by Big John didn't give full height, but has
           the advantage of not using background images in the columns to make it work. Why is this
           good? Because the next step in my design is to make it 3D using images in the background.</p>
		<p>And so came v1.0 of this tool. I took the PIE design, ironed out a few width and alignment
           issues and made it possible to easily create a personalised version of the design without
           the need to understand the (very) complex CSS code, made so by bugs in IE and the Gecko
           engine (at the heart of the Mozilla-based browsers). The first version was simple, using
           a form to enter parameters and lacked validation and error checking. More options were added,
           together with hundreds of lines of coding to validate and error check. By now it was at v1.3.</p>
		<p>v2.0 was the first attempt to combine what I had made of PIE's model with Paul O'Brien's.
           All went quite well, until it came to Mozilla. IE (quite sensibly, I believe) treats the
           height style as a minimum, and will expand vertically if needed. This means it is possible
           to define a design as 100% high and IE will fill the page, and expand further down if the
           content dictates. Mozilla doesn't. It uses the CSS min-height instead. Enter the first set
           of hacks to get around this. Worse was to come, Mozilla has a another bug. It can't inherit
           min-height into child containers. And so in Mozilla, the resulting code looked very odd
           when the content didn't fill the page.</p>
		<p>I have to say that Mozilla caused no end of problems, especially with the header and footer.
           It took an age to find a combination of css and positioning within the page code to get IE
           and Mozilla to render them the same, and a lot of hacks are in the code to achieve this.
           The final hack to get Mozilla to display a full height page with minimal content involved
           placing a dummy design behind the main design, and making areas of the main design transparent
           so that this background could be seen and appear one with the main design. All these hacks
           are then made invisible to IE with another hack!</p>
		<p>However, no matter how hard I tried, this design (v2.0) ended up using two images to get
           it to work reliably. I used the php GD library to make these images on-the-fly. Not ideal
           to use images, but I had to drop the dummy background code because it caused too many
           problems.</p>
		<p>v2.5 used revised code from Big John (his piefecta design) and had tons of screenshot
           help for the Mac browsers from Allan Smith at Telford Steam Railway (thanks Allan). It
           was thoroughly tested on loads of browsers (IE Win 5.x/6, Mozilla, Opera, Safari and
           IE Mac 5.x) and works! Although IE Mac 5.x would not go full height on minimal content
           - sorry, no can do. It also featured Tooltips for the first time on the generator form.</p>
		<p>The php GD image generation was revised, quicker and checked if a suitable image already
           existed. It corrected the http headers bug to give correct filenames in all browsers
           from the save section of the generator form. Also, one of the images use to hack the
           borders was no longer needed. Another bug affecting Mozilla was corrected, so that it
           would automatically open the generator form.</p>
		<p>Tooltips were available for each form entry field. The cut and paste css now had copious
           notes to show how it's done. Tons of bugs were fixed, too many to mention.</p>
		<p>However, the header and footer still couldn't be separated from the body and the left
           column still couldn't be disabled (meaning that this tool couldn't be used to make a one
           column layout - like this page). I may re-introduce this option on a later version.
           Also, there was no option to set the left or top page margins - these are coded to 0.
           I was sure the user could manually set the body side margins needed, but setting the
           top or bottom ones would break the design</p>
		<p>v2.70 was essentially a series of bug fixes:</p>
		   <ul>
              <li>Removed the 1px jog upwards hack for Safari - found a better solution to the
                  <i>screen refresh leaving absolute div's without top or left set</i> bug.</li>
		      <li>Removed the background image hack needed for Gecko engined browsers (Mozilla
                  and Opera). Replaced with a simple but effective additional draw of the
                  background columns.</li>
		      <li>Added the option of top and bottom margins to the design. These are not made
                  by using the margin setting in the body style, <b>do not </b> attempt to do
                  this (change the body style top or bottom margins from 0) as the design will
                  break.</li>
			  <li>Added the option of sub-headers and sub-footers. You can see how to add 3D
                  design content for the backgrounds using these (this page is an example).</li>
              <li>Fixed numerous bugs with the Tooltips in Mozilla and Opera browsers. They now
                  look roughly the same in each!</li>
              <li>Used part of Owen Brigg's css files (www.thenoodleincident.com) to try to offer
                  common font sizing to all browsers, but chnaged the overall font-size to 100.1%.</li>
              <li>Incorrect right column placement in Mozilla/Opera fixed.</li>
              <li>Converted unique divs that were classes to id's.</li>
              <li>Added a container-center div for safer styling of content in center column.
                  Note there is no default style for this div, just add your own.</li>
			  <li>When selecting a HTML 4.01 (Strict or Transitional) doctype the xhtml type
                  tag endings have been changed to normal HTML ones.</li>
              <li><strong>I have found a bug in Opera that is still there in recent versions and probably
                  goes back a long way. If you put tables inside the columns, Opera will
                  incorrectly calculate the table height when making room for the footer, and
                  so the footer will not sit at the bottom of the page. There is, as yet, no fix.
                  IF you must use tables, make sure they have a fixed height, and not have either
                  'no height' or a percentage.</strong></li>
		   </ul>
         <p>And so went version 2.80 and now into v2.90.</p>
           <ul>
		        <li>This version (2.90) is ready to take your code to make your own style using
                    graphics. You can put 3D effect boxes in the header/footer and sidebars. For
                    v3.00 I will enable the Faux Columns and 3D Boxes options.</li>
                <li>Sidebar intrusion into the footer and header is also now possible.</li>
                <li>You can now turn all the useful but unnecessary comments off!</li>
                <li>The repeating background image can now be made in GIF or PNG format.</li>
                <li>It is now possible to turn either left or right sidebars off, or both, and the 
				    unnecesssary code will be removed (much was previously left in when the right 
					sidebar was turned off, and you couldn't turn off the left sidebar).</li>
                <li>The automatic loading of the generated form code is now switched off.  Similarly,
				    the form no longer posts the code back to itself after validation.  Instead, it
					leaves the generator form as it was when the Show Me button was clicked, even if
					the choices included any range or invalid entry errors.  Where any such errors are
					trapped by validation, default values are used.  So, if the form shows a page layout
					different to that expected, check the values you entered for errors.</li>
                <li>Bug fixes? You bet! v2.90 is relatively untested, but seems quite stable though.</li>
            </ul>
         <p>And for v3.00?</p>
           <ul>
                <li>I am planning a choice of 'Faux Columns' templates, to which I hope you can add 
				    your own if you think them worthy.</li>
                <li>Other demo's of css tricks will be made, plus useful links.</li>
                <li>Switch off 'Full Height' hacks for fuller content pages.</li>
                <li>Maybe a re-design of the code to use Big John's Jello Mold ideas.</li>
           </ul>
		<p><b>If</b> you let me know of bugs (or wish list items) that you find, contact me using
           the details at the foot of this page.</p>
		<h2>Images Used</h2>
		<p>If you select a body background pattern, this php-based tool needs to be able to
           generate images on-the-fly, so I have used the gd library to do this. These have
           rather long names that decribe them exactly to the php tool. You need to save these
           files from the display at the foot of the generator form (right mouse-click and
           'save as'). You will also have to edit the page code if you change the default
           directory (assumes the same directory as the html).</p>
		<p>I can't say I'm overfond of fancy background images for pages, but the simple
           patterned ones can look OK <i>if</i> the page alignment is centered (i.e. <b>not</b>
           left-aligned). This code generator only allows a repeated image to be placed in the
           background of the body tag, and only under certain circumstances (check the Tooltips
           for further guidance). Note, only a few designs have been included, if you want me
           to add more, contact me with details of where you have seen one you like.
		<p>Each pattern is made using the background color of the page as a base. The bumps,
           dents and 3d_crosses (looks like that punched steel plate walkways are made of in
           factories) require that the page background color isn't too light, if it is the code
           will darken the chosen color to permit the bumps code to make the pattern. I will
           write the php code to make your chosen image, if I think it worthy of addition.</p>
		<h2>Design Notes on this Template</h2>
		<p>This template comes from a basic demonstration of how to do non-float 3D boxes
           without large images.</p>
		<p>The Tooltips on the generator form page are from Dan Allen at Freshmeat, albeit
           with some mods. Take it from me, Dan's solution is the best freely available!<br /></p>
		<h2>Contacting ClevaTreva</h2>
		<p>At this time, I'm not inviting contact via a form or by e-mail, as I am snowed under
           with work. Instead, you can PM me at any number of forums, on which my username is
           'ClevaTreva' or 'Cleva Treva'. What forums?<br />
