<h1>Who is this Big John?</h1>

<img class="biopic" src="../images/bigjohn.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
Do you need a highly experienced CSS consultant who can work with a team and prides
himself on clean commented code that never says "No" to a client's desired compositions?
Look no further, you've found him.
I'm a middle-aged guy who took up web design in 1999 as a hobby and discovered my
true life's work. I've concentrated on CSS but have also become familiar with Javascript,
PHP, and particularly web graphics production.<br />
</p>
<p>
If you're a Big Wheel (or plan to be one) who requires the services of someone
who <em>really</em> understands HTML,
CSS, and (some) JS, and won't pretend to know more than he does, let's talk.

<h2>Specialties</h2>
<p>
IE6 is on the way out, but it's not dead yet. If you want to take advantage
of the capabilities that IE7 offers but can't ignore the IE6 crowd, I bring extensive
experience to the task of "dumbing&nbsp;down" IE6's display so it won't fail when you
employ advanced CSS and scripting. The methods may be customized to suit
any level of IE6 support you feel comfortable using.
</p>
<p>
Javascript can greatly enhance CSS layouts while degrading gracefully in non-scripting
browsers. Javascript can also help IE6 to behave more in line with modern standards.
I offer such Javascript enhancements and I stand behind their interoperability with
the rest of your scripting environment.
</p>
<p>
I can create most or all of the graphics images needed for a typical site design if desired.
</p>
<p>
In short, you get your CSS'er, JS'er, and graphics guru all together in one moderately
oversized guy. This can result in big savings of time and money on a complex project.
</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>
Most web designers have a portfolio of sites they've designed for clients,
but in my case that portfolio is largely missing. That's because I primarily do
bug fixing and advanced CSS consulting on already-existing sites. However,
numerous past and present clients will attest to my abilities, so without
further ado, here's a few of the choicer ones!
</p>

"A new client asked me to fix some errors in their company website.  Since I
inherited the design from another webmaster, I was just not able to fix the
CSS & HTML bugs that caused the site's navigation links to appear in the
wrong place in MSIE6.  John were invaluable in fixing the 'bugs' for me and
pointing out a few other issues that improved the look and feel of the site.
Thanks for getting the job done quickly and cost-effectively ... I'll be back
again for more expert help in the future.  I highly recommend John's services!"

"Trust me, you can't go wrong with Big John. We stumbled across John
after Googling for fixes to several IE 6 & 7 bugs for Milo.com. He kept
coming up so we thought we'd give him a shot. He's great! Very fast and
responsive. Can fix any problem you're dealing with. He's also willing to
explain fixes to prevent you from running into similar issues in the future
which is very helpful."

"I call Big John my CSS guru. He was a life saver when I was struggling to learn CSS layout.
When my code breaks, I call on him to know what's changed in the browser world and how
to fix it. Having him trouble-shoot my code saves me time and money! He's quick and easy
to work with."

“John is one of the best CSS programmers I have had the opportunity to work with.
His ability to translate visual design into cross-platform compatible HTML, PHP and
CSS pages is excellent. He has an uncanny ability to immediately trouble shoot a browser

"Most of my users are elderly and still use IE6. I needed help with flyouts and floats.
John was quick to grasp my site’s problems and quicker to provide solutions. I decided
to have John go thru the whole site and clean it up. It now looks better and works in all
browsers. John was prompt to finish tasks and he emailed file updates with complete
instructions.  I’ve recommended him to everyone I know."

"Big John is a valuable part of my programming team.   He represents
accurately what he can and can't do and delivers on his promises.  He is
willing to explain things to the lay person so they understand the choices
they are making in different coding choices.  He also works well with other
programmers when a team effort is required.  I recommend him and continue to
use his services."
