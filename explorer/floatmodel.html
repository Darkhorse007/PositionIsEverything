<h2>Float model? What's that?</h2>
<p>
Okay, here is a simple test concerning how static elements interact with floats. According to the W3C specifications,
when a floated element is directly followed by a static element (one that is normally flowed), then first,
the float will be displayed against the left edge of the containing element (in this case the 'body' element),
and then the static element will also display against that same edge, and at the same vertical height as
the float.
</p>
<p>
The float should overlay the static element, unless the static element has a left margin that
moves it out to the right, and out from behind the float. The static element might also be 'cleared'
(clear:left or clear:both), which would put it below the level of the float.
</p>
<h2>Details of the test</h2>
<p>
The green bordered box (div#left) is floated left in the 'body', and is followed by div#static (purple box).
If div#static had no width, then all modern browsers would display correctly, with the purple box
overlaid by the green bordered box.
</p>
<p>
But, because div#static is <strong>width defined</strong>, browser variance is fully evident.
That 'width' declaration makes <strong>Internet&nbsp;Explorer</strong> put div#static
alongside the float as tho the float were part of the left body edge. The latest Win versions
of <strong>Firefox</strong>, <strong>Opera</strong>, <strong>Safari</strong> and all the
Mac-based browsers other than IE5/Mac do it according to the specs, with both boxes
firmly pinned to the left body edge.
</p>
<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>
Making sophisticated use of float layouts sometimes requires stating the 'widths' on some boxes, but
doing so to a static box that follows a float makes IE display differently than any browser that dares
to adhere to the standards. So differently in fact, as to make the situation impossible to ignore.
</p>
<p>
A big problem with this issue occurs when one attempts to use the
<a href="../articles/haslayout.html"><strong>Zoom&nbsp;Fix</strong></a>
on that static float-following box. This is because just like width, the Zoom&nbsp;Fix triggers
<a href="http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html"><strong>hasLayout</strong></a>
on a box, so you get the same improper float model in IE. But if there are float bugs going on
inside the box you will have to make some kind of compromise or maybe redesign the layout entirely
to get satisfactory results.
</p>
<p>
So the choice is to code only for IE, knowing the minority browsers will break, or avoid using any of the
hasLayout triggering properties, putting many types of layouts 'off&nbsp;limits'. Some choice.
</p>
<h2>IE6 is not IE5.5</h2>
<p>
The demo you see here is fully pixel defined, but usually a layout has the widths in percentages, at least for the
elements following the float. When div#static is given a percentage width, IE5.5 looks at the available horizontal space
alongside the float and says "That is now defined as 100% of the width". So if div#static gets 'width: 50%;', that div is
half as wide as the space next to the float and starts next to the float as mentioned.
</p>
<p>
However, IE6 is different. Yes IE6 does start the div next to the float, but it does <em>not</em> take the float
into consideration when figuring the width of div#static. Rather it uses the entire container as the 100% width
refrence, just as the specs require. Yet it <em>does</em> start the div alongside the float! So the problem is only
half-fixed in IE6, creating one more headache for us poor coders.
</p>
<p>
What does this mean? Well, if the div is given a width of 100%, it is as wide as the body element, and being placed
next to the float it forces the right edge of the body element sideways by the width of the float, causing a scrollbar.
<em>But only in IE6!</em> As if this mess weren't already bad enough. Oy.
</p>

<h2>IE7 is not a big improvement</h2>

<p>
It was hoped that IE7 would eliminate the bad old IE float model, but instead MS just
complicated the issue. Check out this
