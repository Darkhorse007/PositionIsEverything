<h1>
So you want to create a demo, do you?
</h1>
<p>
Well compadre, you are our kind of people! We firmly believe that the best way 
to build coding skills, writing talent, and web design acumen is to create bug demos.
All the intellectual muscles are exercised, and it's for a good cause too, so virtue 
is greatly enhanced while bad karma is deducted from your account!
</p>
<p>
If you have a bug that you believe should be demoized, don't hesitate to run it by us.
We're just big lovable fuzzballs, really! We may or may not be impressed, but you have our word 
that we won't denigrate anyone, no matter what. 
</p>
<p>
However, be aware that we will not allow shoddy, half-formed demos to besmirch PIE.
You will need to work hard and cover all the bases. We won't mess with your styling or text (much),
but technical details are something else. A thorough demo is a quality demo.
</p>
<p>
If you feel you can do a demo, but don't have a good bug to demoize, We know of quite a few bugs
that haven't yet been properly covered, so let's talk, okay?
</p>
<p>
If your demo does make it onto our site, there might be quite a bit of exposure for you.
We can't promise anything, but apparently more than a few people have perused PIE,
and outgoing PIE links have been known to seriously pump up search rankings. At least
our sponsor/webhost thinks so!
</p>
<p>
As for content rights, we make <em>no claim whatsoever</em> to any guest demos that may appear
on PIE. What you write is yours forever. We am happy to host quality guest demos on our
site for as long as the creator desires, and if that creator wishes (for any reason) to 
withdraw said demo, we are perfectly agreeable. 
</p>
<p>
So, how 'bout it?  :-)
