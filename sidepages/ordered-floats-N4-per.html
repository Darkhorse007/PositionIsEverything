<!-- This wrapper comes first, and is floated left. It contains the number one (left-floated) col, 
	and the non-floated number two col. The number three col is non-floated, and
	comes last following the wrapper float. -->


<div class="first-float">
<p>
This demo works in Nav4/win, and will show sizable gaps between the cols 
at most screen sizes. All the boxes have borders to show the 'permanent' spaces that
surround the floats, and the borders. The third col actually has a small amount of extra top padding to 
adjust the first text line into alignment with the other cols.
</p>
<p>
Using this code will require some 
<a href="http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=CssHacks">browser hiding hacks</a> 
to keep the Nav4 and non-Nav4 code 
from mixing together. This page does not address the many unrelated Nav4 bugs that
may be encountered when using this layout.
</p>
<p>
If the clearing element is a paragraph, the layout breaks. A div or hx element is fine.
